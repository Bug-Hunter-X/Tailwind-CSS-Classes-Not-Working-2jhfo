# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: classes not applying styles as expected.  This often stems from misconfigurations in the build process, preventing Tailwind from correctly processing the directives.

## Bug Description
The provided code snippet intends to render a red div with white text. However, due to a problem in the Tailwind integration, the styling is not applied.

## Solution
The solution typically involves ensuring the Tailwind directives are properly incorporated into your CSS build process (e.g., using PostCSS or a similar tool). Specific instructions depend on your project setup (Webpack, Vite, etc.) but commonly involve importing the Tailwind stylesheet and configuring your CSS post-processing.
